## Implementing Bundler

Bundler allows you to denote which gems the app uses and lock your specific version. Then, it gives others a command to automatically install those gems. It's a great gem version tracker for large apps.

Start by using bundle init and then you can add gems to the gemfile.

Include the bundler by adding require 'bundler' and Bundler.require to the top of your code.
